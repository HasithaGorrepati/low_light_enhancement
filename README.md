# Low-Light Image Enhancement using Zero-DCE
This project focuses on implementing the Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation (Zero-DCE) method to enhance low-light images. The method uses a lightweight deep network (DCE-Net) to adjust pixel-wise curves, improving brightness, contrast, and overall visibility without needing reference images.

We trained and tested the model using the LOL dataset and DarkFace dataset. Different parameters were explored to analyze their impact on the results. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Zero-DCE for enhancing image quality in various low-light conditions.

# Key Highlights
No reference images required for training.
Lightweight and efficient model architecture.
Tested on LOL and DarkFace datasets.
Results show improved visibility and reduced noise in low-light images.
